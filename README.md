# Tribute Page - "mon - your online plant warehouse"
====================================================

# Why this subject?
===================

##
I love to look after plants, therefore I decided to make a tribute page to some of my favourite types of plant in the form of a brief and largely visual eshop landing page.


# What did I learn?
===================

##
A lot! The main skill that I have acquired is understanding and using git, which was helped greatly by playing the "Oh My Git" game. I'm quite a visual person, so
seeing it like that has allowed me to now conceptualise where I'm at when just using text with terminal. I'm also now feeling a lot more efficient and confident with it
and would say that I'm seventy percent convinced that it is quicker than manually doing it with a mouse.

As well, I followed some additional videos on changing style upon hover. This cemented my understanding of the class and id systems, how they can simplify code by
reducing the amount of lines necessary and also the importance of understanding inheritance. 


# Reflections on the journey so far?
====================================

##
Had a brief moment today where I thought I had completely messed up my github repository and was certain I'd need to ask for help. However, after a short walk outside,
I returned and managed to fix things in less than two minutes. The issue was with the naming of my html and css files, which needed to be named index and style respectively,
or else they would not display with github pages.
